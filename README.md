Fig.2 | The risk of overall antimicrobial resistance and other specific types of resistance in rifaximin initiators at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the index date compared to non-users.

Fig.3 | The risk of infection-related adverse events, including sepsis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and mortality, in rifaximin initiators at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the index date compared to non-users.

Fig.4 | The risk of last-line antibiotic use, including daptomycin and linezolid, in rifaximin initiators at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the index date compared to non-users.
