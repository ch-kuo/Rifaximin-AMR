Fig.2 | The risk of overall antimicrobial resistance and other specific types of resistance in rifaximin initiators at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the index date compared to non-users. CI, confidence interval; ESBL, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases; HR, hazard ratio.

Fig.3 | The risk of infection-related adverse events, including sepsis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and mortality, in rifaximin initiators at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the index date compared to non-users. CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBP; spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Fig.4 | The risk of last-line antibiotic use, including daptomycin and linezolid, in rifaximin initiators at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the index date compared to non-users. ABX, antibiotics; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.

Fig.5 | The risk of overall antimicrobial resistance in rifaximin initiators compared to non-users by age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis, and previous use of antibiotics. ABX, antibiotics; CI: confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.

Fig.6 | Mortality risk in rifaximin initiators compared to non-users by age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis, and previous use of antibiotics. ABX, antibiotics; CI: confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio.
